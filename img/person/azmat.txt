I find it incredible to think that technology has reached the point that we're solving problems
 using the quantum mechanical nature of single electrons. I am looking forward to becoming part
 of the next generation of computer Engineers.
 have also explored networking through the CISCO course at my school and experimentation at home.
 Building physical networks and trying to troubleshoot them is engaging and the satisfaction of
 finding the missing piece to the puzzle after hours of trial and refinement is unbeatable.
