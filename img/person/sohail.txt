 All my life, I have had a fascination and interest in computing and technology. I have always enjoyed keeping up-to-date with the latest
 advances in technology and have remained amazed at the speed of computerised developments over the past few years.
 My programming, information systems and data communications experiences in
 Higher computing and Advanced Higher Computing have since further convinced me
 that I would particularly enjoy studying computer science and there was the begining of my bachelor's Journey in Kardan university.
 During my time in the University I have always looked forward to gain a further, more advanced knowledge of these topics as
 well as learning about new, exciting subjects in addition.
