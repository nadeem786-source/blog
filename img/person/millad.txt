I started self-studying some basics of computer languages such as C++ and VB when I was 13.
I find it interesting and quite easy to understand and I believe my strong foundation in Math helped me.
I enjoy researching new developments in the IT industry. Recently I have been learning visual basic and
am now looking into .net applications.
I have chosen to study computer science because I am fascinated by how computers work and
I spend most of my spare time designing programs and web pages both static and dynamic.
